    "However, they don't tell you what will happen if you intervene and act\n",
    "in the world in new ways. For example, imagine you have been analyzing\n",
    "data at your organization and find that employees who are less stressed\n",
    "tend to be more productive. It may be very unclear *why* that\n",
    "relationship exists. Some possibilities include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Stress reduces productivity\n",
    "2.  Productivity reduces stress\n",
    "3.  Some other variable is causing both of them\n",
    "\n",
    "It is worth putting real thought into all of these.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  For example, it is reasonable that stress reduces productivity.\n",
    "2.  However, it is also reasonable that getting things done may take\n",
    "    stress off of the shoulders of employees as they clear projects off\n",
    "    their to-do lists.\n",
    "3.  It is also possible that something else may be casing both high\n",
    "    stress and low productivity, such as obligations outside of work,\n",
    "    health issues, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "All three of these have different implications for how to increase\n",
    "productivity:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The first possibility suggests that reducing stress might actually\n",
    "    help.\n",
    "2.  The second possibility suggests that reducing stress will not help\n",
    "    (but finding other contributors to productivity might, so we should\n",
    "    go looking for those). Time for more research!\n",
    "3.  The third possibility suggests that attempts to reduce stress would\n",
    "    do nothing to increase productivity because the real problem is the\n",
    "    unmeasured *prior cause* of the stress. For example, if health\n",
    "    issues are causing people to be more stressed and less productive,\n",
    "    then the desired boost to productivity will not come from reducing\n",
    "    stress but from fixing the underlying health issues.\n",

    "In conclusion, association claims are limited in their ability to help\n",
    "you draw cause-effect conclusions. Or, to put it differently, we could\n",

    "information. Association claims simply don't really tell you what is\n",
    "causing what.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: The Experiment\n",
    "========================\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, we run an experiment. Imagine we randomly assign\n",
    "250 employees to a stress-reduction treatment or a \"business-as-usual\"\n",
    "control group. After 7 weeks, the productivity of these employees is\n",
    "assessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because employees are *randomly* assigned to groups *by the researcher*,\n",
    "the research can be confident that\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The two groups were approximately equal to begin with (this can be\n",
    "    checked, if desired)\n",
    "-   Any differences at the end of the study are due to the treatment\n",
    "\n",
    "We can draw this conclusion because we will be very careful to treat the\n",
    "groups *identically* in every way, except for the treatment. We must be\n",
    "**exceedingly** careful on this point, as any unintended differences in\n",
    "treatment (the messaging we give them, the scheduling, workload, etc.)\n",
    "could accidentally cause a second systematic difference between our\n",
    "groups, and then we would not be sure what was really responsible for\n",
    "any effects we end up seeing. This is known as a *confound* and it would\n",
    "run our experiment. We will be very sure not to allow this to happen,\n",
    "using strict protocols, scripts, email templates, etc. We would be very\n",
    "careful to manage expectations so neither group had different\n",
    "expectations (possibly keeping our employees blind to some of the\n",
    "details, or keeping managers in the dark). Our goal will be to keep\n",
    "**everything the same between our groups**, tangibly and mentally,\n",
    "except for the actual treatment itself. This will take very detailed and\n",
    "rigorous planning, but it is worth it. A small-scale pilot of an\n",
    "intervention program will take some rigorous planning, but it is much\n",
    "less expensive than rolling out a company-wide stress program only to\n",
    "find it is a waste of money and ineffective (as might happen in many\n",
    "organizations).\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyzing the Experiment\n",
    "========================\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze the experiment, a simple independent-groups *t*-test can be\n",
    "performed. This compares the means of the two groups to determine if\n",
    "they are statistically significantly different.\n",
