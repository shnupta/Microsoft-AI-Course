    "### A Sample Estimate\n",
    "\n",
    "We have discussed statistical hypothesis testing a number of times in\n",
    "this course, but we haven't yet discussed it in detail with respect to\n",
    "correlations. So, here is a brief refresher on the need for significance\n",
    "testing, applied to correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, are working with a sample of regions at one point in time. What if\n",
    "we wanted to estimate, in a broader way, the association between\n",
    "happiness and life expectancy? Assuming our data are representative of\n",
    "the broader population (e.g., across times, regions, etc.; a big\n",
    "assumption!), we could use this sample correlation (symbol: *r* = .78)\n",
    "as an estimate of the population correlation (symbol: *ρ*). In other\n",
    "words, we don't know the true correlation between happiness and life\n",
    "expectancy in the population, but if we can trust this data to\n",
    "adequately represent it, we can *estimate* it at .78.\n",
    "\n",
    "The estimation piece is important. Often, people look at the sample\n",
    "correlation and don't realize that it's specific to that sample. For\n",
    "example, an organization might collect a survey to assess the link\n",
    "between customer satisfaction and consumption. Whatever correlation\n",
    "observed in the sample is only an estimate--our best guess--of the\n",
    "correlation in the broader population. Were that organization to collect\n",
    "another sample, they would get a different correlation. Every time, the\n",
    "correlation would vary slightly, because the sample is different and\n",
    "only representing (but not being) the population. This raises an\n",
    "important point: sample correlations are imperfect estimates of their\n",
    "population counterparts. The sample estimate has error built into it.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important consequence is that it is possible that the correlation in\n",
    "the population is actually zero (*H*<sub>0</sub> : *ρ* = 0) even when it\n",
    "is not in the sample (e.g., *r* = .12). In other words, the sample\n",
    "correlation could be a statistical fluke of the sample. We cannot say,\n",
    "just because the sample correlation is nonzero, that the two variables\n",
    "truly are correlated in the population. We will need to conduct a\n",
    "statistical significance test first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, we can *only* trust the sample correlation as an estimate of\n",
    "the population correlation *if* the data are representative. If only a\n",
    "certain kind of person selects into the survey (e.g., a certain\n",
    "personality type, people who have strong feelings about a product,\n",
    "etc.), then the sample correlation will estimate the correlation for\n",
    "*that population only.* This essentially means that all research data is\n",
    "biased toward whoever is over-represented in the sample. For this\n",
    "reason, getting good information on whoever is represented in one's data\n",
    "is very important for qualifying the results. In some cases, it may be\n",
