    "## Overview of KNN classification\n",
    "\n",
    "Before discussing a specific algorithm, it helps to know a bit of machine learning terminology. In supervised machine learning a set of ***cases*** are used to ***train***, ***test*** and ***evaluate*** the model. Each case is comprised of the values of one or more ***features*** and a ***label*** value. The features are variables used by the model to ***predict** the value of the label. Minimizing the ***errors*** between the true value of the label and the prediction supervises the training of this model. Once the model is trained and tested, it can be evaluated based on the accuracy in predicting the label of a new set of cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will use randomly selected cases to first train and then evaluate a k-nearest-neighbor (KNN) machine learning model. The goal is to predict the type or class of the label, which makes the machine learning model a ***classification*** model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The k-nearest-neighbor algorithm is conceptually simple. In fact, there is no formal training step. Given a known set of cases, a new case is classified by majority vote of the K (where $k = 1, 2, 3$, etc.) points nearest to the values of the new case; that is, the nearest neighbors of the new case. \n",
    "\n",
    "The schematic figure below illustrates the basic concepts of a KNN classifier. In this case there are two features, the values of one shown on the horizontal axis and the values of the other shown on the vertical axis. The cases are shown on the diagram as one of two classes, red triangles and blue circles. To summarize, each case has a value for the two features, and a class. The goal of the KNN algorithm is to classify cases with unknown labels. \n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing with the example, on the left side of the diagram the $K = 1$ case is illustrated. The nearest neighbor is a red triangle. Therefore, this KNN algorithm will classify the unknown case, '?', as a red triangle. On the right side of the diagram, the $K = 3$ case is illustrated. There are three near neighbors within the circle. The majority of nearest neighbors for $K = 3$ are the blue circles, so the algorithm classifies the unknown case, '?', as a blue circle. Notice that class predicted for the unknown case changes as K changes. This behavior is inherent in the KNN method.  \n",
