    "# Support Vector Machine Models\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support vector machines (SVMs)** are a widely used and powerful category of machine learning algorithms. There are many variations on the basic idea of an SVM. An SVM attempts to **maximally seperate** classes by finding the **suport vector** with the lowest error rate or maximum separation. SVMs can use many types of **kernel functions**. The most common kernel functions are **linear** and the **radial basis function** or **RBF**. The linear basis function attempts to separate classes by finding hyperplanes in the feature space that maximally separate classes. The RBF uses set of local Gaussian shaped basis kernels to find a nonlinear separation of the classes. "

    "Overall, these performance metrics seem acceptable.  A large majority of high credit risk customers are identified, but at the cost of a large number of false positives and a low precision for the negative cases. However, one should be cautious. The reported AUC is quite a bit better than the mean achieved with the 5 fold cross validation. It is likely these figures are optimistic. "
