    "# Naive Bayes Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will work with **naive Bayes models**. Naive Bayes models are a surprisingly useful and effective simplification of the general Bayesian models. Naive Bayes models make the naive assumption of statistical independence of the features. In many cases, naive Bayes module are surprisingly effective despite violating the assumption of independence. \n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, naive Bayes models use empirical distributions of the features to compute probabilities of the labels. The naive Bayes models can use most any family of distributions for the features. It is important to select the correct distribution family for the data you are working with. Common cases are:\n",
    "- **Gaussian;** for continuous or numerical features.\n",
    "- **Bernoulli;** for features with binary values. \n",
    "- **Multinomial;** for features with more than two categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "These is one pit fall, the model fails if a zero probability is encountered. This situation occurs when there is a 'hole' in the sample space where there are no samples. A simple smoothing procedure can deal with this problem. The smoothing hyperparameter, usually called alpha, is one of the few required for naive Bayes models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Some properties of naive Bayes models are:\n",
    "- Computational complexity is linear in number of parameter/features, making naive Bayes models highly scalable. There are out or core approaches suitable for massive datasets.\n",
    "- Requires minimal data to produce models that generalizes well. If there are only a few cases per category to train a model a naive Bayes model can be a good choice. \n",
    "- Have a simple and inherent regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes models are used in many situations including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Document classification\n",
    "- SPAM detection\n",
    "- Image classification \n",
