    "# Feature Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature selection** can be an important part of model selection. In supervised learning, including features in a model which do not provide information on the label is useless at best and may prevent generalization at worst.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature selection can involve application of several methods. Two important methods include:\n",
    "1. Eliminating features with **low variance** and **zero variance**. Zero variance features are comprised of the same values. Low variance features arise from features with most values the same and with few unique values. One way low variance features can arise, is from dummy variables for categories with very few members. The dummy variable will be mostly 0s with very few 1s. \n",
    "2. Training machine learning models with features that are **uninformative** can create a variety of problems. An uninformative feature does not significantly improve model performance. In many cases, the noise in the uninformative features will increase the variance of the model predictions. In other words, uninformative models are likely to reduce the ability of the machine learning model to generalize.   \n",
    "\n",
    "****\n",
    "**Note:** the second case of feature selection involves applying a selection statistic or hypothesis test multiple times. For large number of features, this process is very likely to lead to false positive and false negative results. This likely outcome is known as the **multiple comparisons problem** in statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this problem, consider the decision to keep a feature in a model as a hypothesis test. Any hypothesis test has some probability of both a false positive result and a false negative result. Consider a case where there are 40 uninformative features which are excluded from the model with 95% confidence. There will be an approximately 5% chance of accepting a feature which should be rejected. In this case we would expect about 2 uninformative features to be accepted because of these errors. \n",
    "\n",
    "You may well ask, if testing features for importance can fail with large numbers of features, what is the alternative? The most general and scalable alternative is to use regularization methods. Consider applying regularization methods to a linear model. In this case, machine learning algorithm learns which features should be weighted highly and which should not. \n",
