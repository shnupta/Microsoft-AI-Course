    "# Regularization and the bias-variance trade-off\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overfitting** is a constant danger with machine learning models. Overfit models fit the training data well. However, an overfit model will not **generalize**. A model that generalizes is a model which exhibits good performance on data cases beyond the ones used in training. Models that generalize will be useful in production. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a general rule, an overfit model has learned the training data too well. The overfitting likely involved learning noise present in the training data. The noise in the data is random and uninformative. When a new data case is presented to such a model it may produce unexpected results since the random noise will be different. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, what is one to do to prevent overfitting of machine learning models? The most widely used set of tools for preventing overfitting are known as **regularization methods**. Regularization methods take a number of forms, but all have the same goal, to prevent overfitting of machine learning models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regularization is not free however. While regularization reduces the **variance** in the model results, it introduces **bias**. Whereas, an overfit model exhibits low bias the variance is high. The high variance leads to unpredictable results when the model is exposed to new data cases. On the other hand, the stronger the regularization of a model the lower the variance, but the greater the bias. This all means that when applying regularization you will need to contend with the **bias-variance trade-off**. \n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand the bias variance trade-off consider the following examples of extreme model cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the prediction for all cases is just the mean (or median), variance is minimized. The estimate for all cases is the same, so the bias of the estimates is zero. However, there is likely considerable variance in these estimates. \n",
    "- On the other hand, consider what happens when the data are fit with a kNN model with k=1. The training data will fit this model perfectly, since there is one model coefficient per training data point. The variance will be low. However, the model will have considerable bias when applied to test data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In either case, these extreme models will not generalize well and will exhibit large errors on any independent test data. Any practical model must come to terms with the trade-off between bias and variance to make accurate predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand this trade-off you can consider the example of the mean square error, which can be decomposed into its components. The mean square error can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta x = E \\Big[ \\big(Y - \\hat{f}(X) \\big)^2 \\Big] = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\big(y_i - \\hat{f}(x_i) \\big)^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where,\n",
    "$Y = $ the label vector.  \n",
    "$X = $ the feature matrix.   \n",
    "$\\hat{f}(x) = $ the trained model.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Expanding the representation of the mean square error:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\Delta x = \\big( E[ \\hat{f}(X)] - \\hat{f}(X) \\big)^2 + E \\big[ ( \\hat{f}(X) - E[ \\hat{f}(X)])^2 \\big] + \\sigma^2\\\\\n",
    "\\Delta x = Bias^2 + Variance + Irreducible\\ Error$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Study this relationship. Notice that as regularization reduces variance, bias increases. The irreducible error will remain unchanged. Regularization parameters are chosen to minimize $\\Delta x$. In many cases, this will prove challenging. "

The total loss function can then be written as follows:  \n",

For example, if $B_1$ is maximized then $B_2 \\sim 0$, or vice versa. It is important to note that l2 regularization is a **soft constraint**.

Notice that there is a minimum where the l1 parameter has a value of 0.0044. To the left of the minimum variance dominates bias. To the right of the minimum bias dominates variance. Notice that the curve of RMSE has some kinks or sharp bends. This is in contrast to the smooth curve produced by l2 regularization. \n",

At the left the regularization penalty is small and the coefficient values show a wide range of values, giving a high variance model. To the right the coefficient values become more tightly clustered, giving a more constrained and higher bias model. In addition, many of the parameters are being driven to zero as the regularization parameter increases. The parameters being driven to zero account for the kinks in the RMSE curve.   "

    "In this lab you have explored the basics of regularization. Regularization can prevent machine learning models from being overfit. Regularization is required to help machine learning models generalize when placed in production. Selection of regularization strength involves consideration of the bias-variance trade-off. \n",

    "L2 and l1 regularization constrain model coefficients to prevent overfitting. L2 regularization constrains model coefficients using a Euclidian norm. L2 regularization can drive some coefficients toward zero, usually not to zero. On the other hand, l1 regularization can drive model coefficients to zero. "
